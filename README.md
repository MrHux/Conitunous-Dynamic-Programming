# Conitunous-Dynamic-Programming
This project implement the Continuous Dynamic Programming algorithm. It enable the comparison between two matrix.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program can compare two matrix and return a vector of the distance between the two matrix. We use it to compare two pictures.
We have many pictures of text from a book and we have the associated matrix of charactertic (pixels color,...). 
With our algorithm we can compare two picture, on picture is from a sentence of the book and the other is just one word.
Using our program we can compare the two pictures and see if the picture of the word is inside the picture of the sentence or not.
